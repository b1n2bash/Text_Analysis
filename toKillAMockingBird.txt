Atticus said to Jem one day, "Id rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know youll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit em, but remember its a sin to kill a mockingbird." That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. "Your fathers right," she said. "Mockingbirds dont do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They dont eat up peoples gardens, dont nest in corn cribs, they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. Thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird.
